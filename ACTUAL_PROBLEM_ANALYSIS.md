# ACTUAL PROBLEM ANALYSIS

## What You're Experiencing
When you scroll to the documents section, you see a **defaulted uploading section** with documents showing automatically, even though you haven't selected anything or proceeded to documentation.

## What I've Been Doing Wrong
I've been fixing code that MIGHT be causing the issue, but I haven't actually confirmed what's causing it. I keep saying "fixed" without verifying.

## What We Need To Do NOW

### Step 1: Identify What's Actually Visible
When you scroll to documents section, WHAT exactly do you see?
- [ ] A list of GSM documents (Skills Assessment, Employment, etc.)?
- [ ] A list of Student visa documents?
- [ ] An upload interface with file upload boxes?
- [ ] Just the selection dropdowns (Country, Visa Type, Authority)?
- [ ] Something else?

### Step 2: Find Out WHY It's Showing
Once we know WHAT you're seeing, we can trace back to find out WHICH code is making it visible:
- Is it in the HTML (already visible by default)?
- Is it being shown by JavaScript on page load?
- Is it being shown when you navigate to the section?

### Step 3: Fix The RIGHT Thing
Only AFTER we identify the exact code causing the issue can we fix it properly.

## My Action Plan

1. **STOP** making blind fixes
2. **ASK** you to describe exactly what you see
3. **FIND** the exact code causing it
4. **FIX** only that specific code
5. **VERIFY** it's actually fixed

## Questions I Need Answered

1. When you open client-dashboard.html and scroll to the documents section, what EXACTLY do you see?

2. Is there a document list showing? If yes, what documents are in the list?

3. Are there upload boxes showing? If yes, how many?

4. Do you see any text that says "Proceed to Documentation" button?

5. Is the button enabled or disabled?

Please answer these questions so I can fix the ACTUAL problem, not imagined problems.
